# Login and Signup Form Application

## Description

This is a simple ASP.NET Core web application that provides functionality for user registration (signup) and login. The application uses sessions to manage user authentication and follows a database-first approach with Entity Framework Core for data access.

## Features

- **User Signup**: Users can create an account by providing basic information such as username, email, and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in with their credentials.
- **Session Management**: After logging in, a session is created to keep the user authenticated across the application.
- **Database-First Approach**: The database schema is already defined, and Entity Framework Core is used to generate the models and context.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The web framework used for building the application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database access and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **SQL Server**: The database system where user information is stored.
- **Session Management**: For handling user sessions after login.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
